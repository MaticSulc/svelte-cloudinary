## Using Environment Variables

If you're using Vite/SvelteKit the following environment variables are supported:

| Environment Variable                  | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`          | The cloud name of your product environment (required)                                                                  |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`             | Used to sign image upload requests                                                                                     |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRIVATE_CDN`         | Set to `true` if you're an [Advanced Plan](https://cloudinary.com/pricing) user with a private CDN distribution        |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_SECURE_DISTRIBUTION` | The custom delivery hostname for [Advanced Plan](https://cloudinary.com/pricing) users with a private CDN distribution |
| `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`       | A global [upload preset](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_presets) for use with image uploading             |

## Config Helper

If you're unable to use [environment variables](#using-environment-variables), or there isn't one for a config option you want to set _globally_, you can use the `configureCloudinary` function. It uses the Svelte [`context api`](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api), so it needs to be called in your root Svelte component (or root layout in SvelteKit). Since context flows down in Svelte, any children of this root component will automatically be able to detect the Svelte Cloudinary config.

```svelte
<script>
	import { configureCloudinary } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

	configureCloudinary({
		cloudName: 'cloudName',
	});
</script>
```

The following options are available:

```ts
// These options are available on every helper/component
// (see Config Overrides below)
interface ConfigOptions {
	cloud?: {};
	url?: {};
}

interface GlobalCloudinaryConfig extends ConfigOptions {
	analytics?: AnalyticsOptions;
	uploadPreset?: string;
	cloudName?: string;
	apiKey?: string;
}
```

## Config Overrides

You can overwrite the config on individual components/helpers. All components have a `config` prop which accepts the Cloudinary `ConfigOptions` object. This doesn't include the shortcuts such as the top level `cloudName`, and `apiKey` that the global config does.

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage config={{ cloud: { cloudName: 'cloudName' }}} />
```

## Priority

Config options are used in the following order:

-   [Options overrides](#config-overrides)
-   [`configureCloudinary`](#config-helper): `.cloudName` and `.apiKey`
-   [`configureCloudinary`](#config-helper): `.cloud` and `.url`
-   [Environment variables](#using-environment-variables)
