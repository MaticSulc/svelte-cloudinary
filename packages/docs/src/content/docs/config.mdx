title: Configuring Svelte Cloudinary
---

Config options are used in the following order:

- Options provided by component/helper props
- `configureCloudinary`: `.cloudName` and `.apiKey`
- `configureCloudinary`: `.cloud` and `.url`
- Environment variables

## Global Config

The global config option works at runtime by using the [`context api`](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) to set the config for all components. It has a few shortcuts for common options such as `cloudName` and `apiKey`. You'll likely want to run this in your root component, for example in SvelteKit this would be in `src/routes/+layout.svelte`.

```svelte
<script>
	import { configureCloudinary } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

	configureCloudinary({
		cloudName: 'cloudName',
	});
</script>
```

The following options are available:

```ts
// These options are available on every helper/component
// (see #config-overrides below)
interface ConfigOptions {
	cloud?: {}
	url?: {}
}

interface GlobalCloudinaryConfig extends ConfigOptions {
	analytics?: AnalyticsOptions;
	uploadPreset?: string;
	cloudName?: string;
	apiKey?: string;
}
```

## Config Overrides

You can overwrite the config on individual components/helpers. All components have a `config` prop which accepts the Cloudinary config object. This doesn't include the shortcuts such as the top level `cloudName`, and `apiKey` that the global config does.

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage config={{ cloud: { cloudName: 'cloudName' }}} />
```

## Using environment variables

If you're using Vite/SvelteKit the following environment variables are supported:

- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRIVATE_CDN`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_SECURE_DISTRIBUTION`
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
