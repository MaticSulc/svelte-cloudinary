title: Get Started

Svelte Cloudinary works with both Svelte and SvelteKit, you can get started by installing the package:

```bash title="Install dependencies..."
npm install svelte-cloudinary -D
```

## Configuring

You'll need to set your Global Cloudinary config in your root Svelte component. For example in SvelteKit this would be in `src/routes/+layout.svelte`. We are using the [`context api`](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) under the hood.

```svelte
<script>
	import { configureCloudinary } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

	configureCloudinary({
		cloudName: 'cloudName',
	});
</script>
```
