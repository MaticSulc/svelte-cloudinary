Svelte Cloudinary works with both Svelte and SvelteKit, you can get started by installing the package:

```bash title="Install dependencies..."
npm install svelte-cloudinary -D
```

Then you'll need to set your [cloud name](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/finding_your_credentials_tutorial), which can be set wih the `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` environment variable if you're using Vite or SvelteKit. You can read more about [configuring svelte-cloudinary here](/config), including how to use other bundlers.
