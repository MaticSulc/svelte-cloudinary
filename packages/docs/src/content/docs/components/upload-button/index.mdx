The `CldUploadButton` creates a button that wraps the [`CldUploadWidget`](/components/upload-widget) giving you an easy way to add upload capabilities to your Svelte app. It's recommended you use [`CldUploadWidget`](/components/upload-widget) directly and bring your own button.

## Basic Usage

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldUploadButton } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldUploadButton uploadPreset="<Upload Preset>" />
```
