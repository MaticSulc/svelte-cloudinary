The `CldUploadWidget` creates a new instance of the [Cloudinary upload widget](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget).

The widget will not render any UI by default, instead needing to have the `open` function called. The simplest way to do this is to nest a button inside a slot and use the `open` slot prop. There are two options when using the CldUploadWidget: signed and unsigned. These options allow you to control the amount of security and restrictions you place on uploads.

## Unsigned

Providing that unsigned uploads are allowed for your `uploadPreset` you can simply do:

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldUploadWidget } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldUploadWidget uploadPreset="<your upload preset>" let:open>
	<button on:click={() => open()}>
		Open the widget
	</button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```

## Signed

Signing upload requests require passing in a signature endpoint which uses your Cloudinary secret key to sign the upload request. The following example uses SvelteKit but you can use any server framework to write this:

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldUploadWidget } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldUploadWidget
	uploadPreset="<your upload preset>"
	signatureEndpoint="/api/sign-cloudinary-params"
	let:open
>
	<button on:click={() => open()}>
		Open the widget
	</button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```

```ts
// src/routes/api/sign-cloudinary-params/+server.ts
import { CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET } from '$env/static/private';
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';
import { error, json } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const POST = async ({ request }) => {
	const body = await request.json();
	const { paramsToSign } = body;

	try {
		const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(paramsToSign, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET);
		return json({ signature });
	} catch (e) {
		return error(500, `${error}`);
	}
};
```
